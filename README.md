## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
The dataset was retrieved from an Oracle database and loaded into a Jupyter Notebook for analysis.

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values using median and mode
- Removed duplicate records
- Standardized categorical variables

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Converted dependents into numerical values
- Encoded loan status (Approved / Rejected)
- Created **Total Income** feature by combining applicant and co-applicant incomes

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyzed multiple factors affecting loan approval such as:

- Credit history  
- Applicant income  
- Loan amount  
- Education  
- Marital status  
- Dependents  

### 5️⃣ Visualization
Generated plots including:

- Loan approval distribution  
- Income histograms  
- Loan amount trends  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Boxplots for outlier detection
